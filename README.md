# PercentageDifferenceCalculator
A Shyny web app to calculate the difference between two numbers

Have you ever needed a quick and easy way to calculate the percentage difference between two numbers? Well, here you go!

## About the app

PercentageDifferenceCalculator... Oh wait, that's horrible! Let's call it PDC.

PDC is a web application that takes two numbers and returns the percentage difference between them.

But why would I use this app when there are plenty others around, you may say?

I'm glad you asked!

Others apps cause hair loss. Believe me, I know.

OK, enough chatting already! Let's get started!

## How to use

1. Open the app: <https://tbulligan.shinyapps.io/PercentageDifferenceCalculator/>
2. Put your first number in _Original number_
3. Put your second number in _New number_

NOTE: Allowed characters are `digits`, `.`, `-`. `e`.

EXAMPLES: `42.01`. `-12.776`, `1.8e10`, `6.5-e2`

That's it!

On the right you will find:

* The difference between the numbers in digits
* The percentage difference between the numbers
