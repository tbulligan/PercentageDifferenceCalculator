# PercentageDifferenceCalculator
A Shyny web app to calculate the difference between two numbers

Have you ever needed a quick and easy way to calculate the percentage difference between two numbers? Well, here you go!

## About the app

PercentageDifferenceCalculator... Oh wait, that's horrible! Let's call it PDC.

PDC is a web application that takes two numbers and returns the percentage difference between them.

But why would I use this app when there are plenty others around, you may say?

I'm glad you asked!

Many similar  apps (I haven't tested them all but _you_ can if you want) round the percentage difference to a set number of decimals.

Others cause hair loss. Believe me, I know.

OK, enough chatting already! Let's get started!

## How to use

1. Go to the app: <https://tbulligan.shinyapps.io/PercentageDifferenceCalculator/>
2. Put your first number in _Original number_
3. Put your second number in _New number_

That's it!

On the right you will find:

* The difference between the numbers in digits
* The percentage difference between the numbers

### Examples

* By how much did Husain Bolt beat Yohan Blake in the 100m men final at the London 2012 Olympics Games?
* How big is the sun compared to Earth?
* How much older will I be next year?
